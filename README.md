<h1>Tensorflow 2.0 : ANN MNIST</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
ANN MNIST Project with TensorFlow

This project is an implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the TensorFlow library to classify the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

The goal of this project is to build a neural network model that can accurately classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset. The implementation utilizes the TensorFlow framework, which provides a flexible and efficient platform for developing and training deep learning models.

The project consists of several key steps. First, the MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed to normalize the pixel values and convert the labels into one-hot encoded vectors. Then, an ANN model is constructed using TensorFlow's high-level API, Keras. The architecture of the model typically includes input and output layers, along with one or more hidden layers, each consisting of densely connected nodes (also known as neurons).

After building the model, it is trained using the training set of the MNIST dataset. The training process involves iteratively feeding batches of input images to the model, calculating the loss between the predicted and actual labels, and updating the model's weights using an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

Once the model is trained, its performance is evaluated using the testing set of the MNIST dataset. The accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics are computed to assess the model's classification performance.

The code for this project can be found in the GitHub repository, along with any necessary instructions or dependencies. The repository serves as a valuable resource for developers and machine learning enthusiasts who want to understand and experiment with ANN models using TensorFlow and the MNIST dataset.

By exploring this project, users can gain hands-on experience with building, training, and evaluating neural networks for image classification tasks, while also understanding the fundamentals of TensorFlow and its integration with deep learning models.
